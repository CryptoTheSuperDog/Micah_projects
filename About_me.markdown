# How I Started Coding
I have been coding since my second year in my Physics Bachelors (2017). We coded equations and physics simulations. I started out learning to code games on youtube and then branched out into many other ventures. My most comfortable coding language is Python, but I know Java and SQL as well. I also know Machine and Deep Learning as I have been studying Data Science. My projects align with my Hobbies for the most part.
