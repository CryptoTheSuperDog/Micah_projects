# About The Wav Files
In this folder there are 12 songs (as .wav files) that I use to remember the 12 tones of the chromatic scale. Some of them are too large to put on github, therefore what I have done is put them in my google drive and opened them up to anyone with the link. I will tell you all of the files and which songs they are. Notice that to map your brain to a certain note frequency you only have to know what note the song is playing and where that is happening. For me most of these songs have the note at the start except One punch man and Fairy fountain. But these are just my examples, please use your own for best learning.
