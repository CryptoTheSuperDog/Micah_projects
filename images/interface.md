Above is the tkinter interface that comes up when you run the script. (tkinter is what is used to generate it)
There are 5 buttons on the top for the five different levels of the JLPT test (Japanese-Language Proficiency Test). 
Level 5 is the easiest and level 1 is the hardest. The kanji that is generated by pressing the new button is based on the jlpt tests.

# How to Use 
1. Press new to generate a kanji from the jlpt test, default level is 5 or beginner. You can also type in the box which will appear on the top of the screen (Type romanized japanese words not english, ex// arigatou = thank you)
2. Next you will want to press the examples button to generate an example sentence, some of the sentences can be complicated so you can press it again to get a different one
3. If there are kanji you don't know this is perfect, because you can press the hiragana button for the translation
4. If you dont know what it means in english or want to check yourself, press the english button to translate it to english
5. Repeat until you master the japanese language, obviously use other tools too. (ahem, Youtube)
