# Why did I make this
This Program I created in order to help me practice reading Japanese to supplement my learning on Youtube, Textbooks, speaking to people on hello talk etc...
I wanted it to be fluid in that I can switch to studying N3 kanji then review N4 then learn N2 in an instant. Also I can try and generate an example sentence in my head with that word to see if I get the meaning and then compare it to the various example sentences on this program to test myself. I can also type in words or phrases I want to see example sentences with which is helpful as well

# Packages needed 
You can install any package using -pip install ________ (fill in the blank). The packages you need to check if you have are in the first 10 lines on the GetKanji.py file. Some of them should already be on your computer. 

# Web Scrapping
Web scrapping is a way to get data from a site, you could also use an API (Application Programming Interface, just sets up connection between a device and a database) if one is available. I have used the technique of webscrapping, but you have to be careful because some sites arent okay with you taking the info off of it. To be safe, you can see what a site doesn't allow you to take by typeing "/robots.txt" after the link in the web browser. For example, www.tanoshiijapanese.com as www.tanoshiijapanese.com/robots.txt. This site is telling us that we can not use the sounds in it (which I don't)
